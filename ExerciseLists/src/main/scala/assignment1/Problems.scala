    * A postman has a list of delivery addresses, for which he and his colleague are responsible.
    * The addresses they have to visit are split into odd and even - one part for each of them.
    * He can choose which part he wants to take. Being lazy, he wants to take the one,
    * where he will be done faster.
    *
    * All addresses are located on a very long street and all odd ones are on one side
    * and the even ones on the other.
    * The distance between 2 addresses can be computed based on their address number.
    *
    * E.x the distance between 40 and 42 ist 1, because they are next to each other
    * (all even numbers on one side, odd on the other).
    * The distance between 40 and 48 is 4.
    * The total distance for the addresses {40, 42, 52} is 6
    *
    * He has to stop at every address and drop off all the mail for this building,
    * which he computes as an extra 2 distance per address.
    * Also taking this into account the distance for the addresses {40, 42, 52} will be 6 + 3x2 = 12
    *
    * The postman starts from one end and goes to the other.
    *
    * Implement the method, which given the addresses predicts which path will be faster.

    * @param addresses the address numbers
    * @return the faster path: true if even, false if odd
